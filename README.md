Hello! I am Denjms. I am interested in making a website and still learning, for now I am still learning and mastering the basics of HTML and CSS.
I am starting to learn web development and these are my projects that I cloned in frontendmentor.io .
I want to challenge myself and I want to become a web developer someday.
